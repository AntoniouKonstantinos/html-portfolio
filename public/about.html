<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Konstantinos, an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>As an entry-level developer, I bring fresh ideas, a strong commitment to learning, and a growing skill set in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. 
   I'm constantly exploring new tools and technologies to enhance my craft and deliver value to every project I work on.
</p>

<p>This website is my very first HTML only website and first of many more that are on the way. 
   I believe every line of code tells a story, and I'm excited to write mine one project at a time.

<p>Thanks for stopping by</p>
